## Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine, but bump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we pull)
* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
